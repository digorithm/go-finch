## Installation

1. Install PostgreSQL 9.4.x

2. Install Go 1.4.x, git, setup `$GOPATH`, and `PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`

3. Create PostgreSQL database.
    ```
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/digorithm/meal_planner
    go get github.com/rnubel/pgmgr
    pgmgr db create
    ```

4. Run the PostgreSQL migration.
    ```
    pgmgr db migrate
    ```

5. Run the server
    ```
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/digorithm/meal_planner
    go run main.go
    ```


## Environment Variables for Configuration

* **HTTP_ADDR:** The host and port. Default: `":8888"`

* **HTTP_CERT_FILE:** Path to cert file. Default: `""`

* **HTTP_KEY_FILE:** Path to key file. Default: `""`

* **HTTP_DRAIN_INTERVAL:** How long application will wait to drain old requests before restarting. Default: `"1s"`

* **DSN:** RDBMS database path. Default: `postgres://$(whoami)@localhost:5432/meal_planner?sslmode=disable`

* **COOKIE_SECRET:** Cookie secret for session. Default: Auto generated.


## Running Migrations

Migration is handled by a separate project: [github.com/rnubel/pgmgr](https://github.com/rnubel/pgmgr).

Here's a quick tutorial on how to use it. For more details, read the tutorial [here](https://github.com/rnubel/pgmgr#usage).
```
# Installing the library
go get github.com/rnubel/pgmgr

# Create a new migration file
pgmgr migration {filename}

# Migrate all the way up
pgmgr db migrate

# Reset to the latest dump
pgmgr db drop
pgmgr db create
pgmgr db load

# Roll back the most recently applied migration, then run it again.
pgmgr db rollback
pgmgr db migrate

# Show the latest migration version
pgmgr db version
```


## Vendoring Dependencies

Vendoring is handled by a separate project: [github.com/tools/godep](https://github.com/tools/godep).

Here's a quick tutorial on how to use it. For more details, read the readme [here](https://github.com/tools/godep#godep).
```
# Save all your dependencies after running go get ./...
godep save ./...

# Building with godep
godep go build

# Running tests with godep
godep go test ./...
```


## Running in Vagrant

There are two potential gotchas you need to know when running in Vagrant:

1. `GOPATH` is not defined when you ssh into Vagrant. To fix the problem, do `export GOPATH=/go` immediately after ssh.

2. PostgreSQL is not installed inside Vagrant. You must connect to your host PostgreSQL. Here's an example on how to run your application inside vagrant while connecting to your host PostgreSQL:
```
GOPATH=/go DSN=postgres://$(whoami)@$(netstat -rn | grep "^0.0.0.0 " | cut -d " " -f10):5432/$PROJECT_NAME?sslmode=disable go run main.go
```
